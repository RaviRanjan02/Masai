// You are given a number stored in a variable with the nameN

// You have to printNlines such that on each line you find the sum of all odd numbers in the range of[1,i], whereirepresents all the numbers in the range of[1,N]

// For example, consider the value stored inN = 3

// Then, first we find the sum of all even numbers, in the range of [1,1], which comes out to be 1, as there is one odd number (1) in the range

// Then, we find the sum of all even numbers, in the range of [1,2], which comes out to be 1, as there is only 1 odd number (1). Hence, the sum becomes 1

// Finally, we find the sum of all even numbers in the range of [1,3], which comes out to be 4, as there are two odd numbers (1,3) in the given range. Hence, the sum becomes 4

// Therefore, the final output becomes

// 1
// 1
// 4
var num=4;
for(var i=1;i<=num;i++){
    var sum=0;
    for(var j=1;j<=i;j++){
        if(j%2!==0){
            // console.log(j);
            sum=sum+j;
        }
